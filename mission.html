	<h2 >Our mission</h2>
	<p class="two">We take the guesswork out of finding clothes that fit by providing automatic size conversions across a variety of brands and giving users personalized sizing suggestions based on their preferences and body type. We try to send a body positive message by creating transparency about the industryâ€™s arbitrary designation of clothing sizes.</p>
	 <p class="two">We hope that informing women about the discrepancies of sizing will alleviate the anxiety of finding a fitting size in a field that historically does not account for different body shapes, sizes, and racial diversity. </p>
