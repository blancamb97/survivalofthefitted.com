	<h2 >About us</h2>
	<p class="two">Our team is comprised of five young adults who have come face to face with the issue of finding the right fit when shopping for clothes, as sizes vary drastically across brands. This is a big problem, especially when shopping online, where trying on several sizes of the same pair of pants or shirt is not an option. This leaves the customer confused, frustrated, and feeling like finding clothes is just a shot in the dark. Why us? We are young, driven women who bring a fresh perspective to a long existing problem that the fashion industry has so far failed to solve. </p2>
	<br>
	<p class="two">Each one of us represents a different body type that are underrepresented in the retail clothing industry, as the fashion world has set an unrealistic “standard” of what the female body should look like. We all have a personal story with a common problem: we struggle to find fitting clothes across brand, that make us feel confident about our bodies. Our team is not alone, as most women have their battle with finding fitting clothes. Our goal is to encourage others to feel comfortable and confident in what they wear without having numbers define who they are.</p2>
